### :white_check_mark: About Braining Training Memory Game 

I'd been wanting to make a game of some sort for a while and I am really happy with the outcome of this one. I wanted to create a brain training game of some sort and I'd not really used React to make this sort of app before. So with the help of a Net Ninja, I created this version of the memory app. 

</br></br>

### :mortar_board: Main Learning Points:

- First time using React to build a game like project, so learned to take it slow and study documentation/google when needed and learn how it worked in this context. 

- Learned about breaking the problem down, planning and tackling one bit of the app at a time. 

- Learned about the way that useState and useEffect work with relation to a project like this. So that was a great discovery! 

- Learned more about CSS Animations and Transitions.
